### About Me
Hello world and welcome! I am an aspiring web developer attending Nashville Software School. I have a strong customer service background which fostered a passion for problem solving, team work, and creative solutions. These attributes are what have now inspired me to delve into the extravagant labrynth that we call code. I will be gaining experience with html, CSS, JavaScript, React, C#, SQL, and .NET. Have a look around and see what I have been working on!
